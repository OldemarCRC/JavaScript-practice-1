# Exercise-3
Exercise 3 repository is a homework of the vocational school Vantaan Ammattiopisto Varia
includes HTML, JavaScript and CSS files.

I am doing this change just to see how this works.
This is another change to use git pull from my local repository.
This line is to change my local repository and push the changes into my GitHub repository, using git push.

Added a new line for testing.
